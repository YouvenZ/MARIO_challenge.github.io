# TASK 2: Prediction of evolution within 3 mounts of AMD on OCT 2D slices for planning treatment anti-VEGF.


2.  The second task focuses on 2D slices level. The goal is to predict the future evolution within 3 months with close monitoring of patients that are enrolled in an anti-VEGF treatments plan.

For the prediction of the evolution within 3 months (Task 2), the following fo classes are defined:

- REDUCED: 0 = ELIMINATED: 1 or PERSISTENT_REDUCED: 2
- STABLE: 1  = INACTIVE: 0 or PERSISTENT_STABLE: 3
- WORSENED: 2 = PERSISTENT_WORSENED: 4 or APPEARED: 6


Like it is illustrated we provide to participants along side with the OCT for each visit an localizers and some clinical data. We encourage the participants to develop multi-modal method to takle this task. **It should be noted that the minimun input expected for your algoritm development should be at least the OCT B-scan.**
