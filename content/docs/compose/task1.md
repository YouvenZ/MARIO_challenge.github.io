### Two tasks will be addressed in the challenge:

1.  The first task focuses on pairs of 2D slices (B-scans) from two consecutive OCT acquisitions. The goal is to classify the evolution between these two slices (before and after), which clinicians typically examine side by side on their screens.![](https://rumc-gcorg-p-public.s3.amazonaws.com/i/2024/04/05/mario_task_1_gray_bg.png)
