### Challenge papers

To ensure transparency and reproducibility, we require participants to submit a brief method description alongside their final test set results. This description should follow the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) format.Â  An Overleaf template is availableÂ Â [template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/springer-lecture-notes-in-computer-science/kzwwpvhwnvfj)Â to facilitate this process.

The paper description should focus on the key steps involved in developing your submitted approach.Â  Here are some recommended elements toÂ  include:

*   Introduction

	*   Pre-processing
	*   Proposed method
	*   Pre-training (if any)
	*   Post-processing (if any)
*   Results
*   Discussion
*   Link to public code repository

You can submit one paper for both tasks, or separate papers for each task. The choice is yours.
