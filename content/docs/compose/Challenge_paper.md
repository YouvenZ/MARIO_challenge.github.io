### Challenge papers

To ensure transparency and reproducibility, we require participants to submit a brief method description alongside their final test set results. This description should follow the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) format.Â  An Overleaf template is availableÂ Â [template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/springer-lecture-notes-in-computer-science/kzwwpvhwnvfj)Â to facilitate this process.

The paper description should focus on the key steps involved in developing your submitted approach.Â  Here are some recommended elements toÂ  include:

*   Introduction
*   MethodÂ  Â 
*   Results
*   Link to public code repository
