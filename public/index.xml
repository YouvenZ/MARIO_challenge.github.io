      <description>Data source(s) characteristics Imaging data was acquired with a Spectralis OCT device (Heidelberg Engineering). B-scan definition was 496x1024 pixels; the number of B-scans per C-scan was patient dependent (typically 49 B- scans). Consecutive examinations were registered using the Spectralis follow-up option. The data was exported in XML+bitmap format using the Spectralis software version 6.9.4.0. Data was collected at the Ophthalmology department of Brest University Hospital (France). All patients are followed-up for monitoring and treatment of vascular AMD.</description>

      <description>For task 1 The following metrics will be used in the leader board for both phase of task 1&#xA;F1-score, Specificity, Rk-correlation coefficient (RkC) For task 2 The following metrics will be used in the leader board for both phase of task 2&#xA;F1-score Specificity Rk-correlation coefficient (RkC) Quadratic weighted Kappa Ranking method(s) Only participants with comprehensive results for the task will appear in the final ranking. In the final ranking, task 2 will be given a higher weight as it is the most challenging and clinically useful task.</description>

      <description>TASK 1: Classify evolution between two pairs of 2-D slices from two consecutive 2D OCT acquisitions. The first task focuses on pairs of 2D slices (B-scans) from two consecutive OCT acquisitions. The goal is to classify the evolution between these two slices (before and after), which clinicians typically examine side by side on their screens. For evolution assessment between two consecutives examination (Task 1), the following fo classes are defined.</description>

      <description>TASK 2: Prediction of evolution within 3 mounts of AMD on OCT 2D slices for planning treatment anti-VEGF. The second task focuses on 2D slices level. The goal is to predict the future evolution within 3 months with close monitoring of patients that are enrolled in an anti-VEGF treatments plan. For the prediction of the evolution within 3 months (Task 2), the following fo classes are defined:&#xA;REDUCED: 0 = ELIMINATED: 1 or PERSISTENT_REDUCED: 2 STABLE: 1 = INACTIVE: 0 or PERSISTENT_STABLE: 3 WORSENED: 2 = PERSISTENT_WORSENED: 4 or APPEARED: 6 Like it is illustrated we provide to participants along side with the OCT for each visit an localizers and some clinical data.</description>

      <description>Challenge papers To ensure transparency and reproducibility, we require participants to submit a brief method description alongside their final test set results. This description should follow the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) format.¬†An Overleaf template is available¬†template¬†to facilitate this process.&#xA;The paper description should focus on the key steps involved in developing your submitted approach.¬†Here are some recommended elements to¬†include:&#xA;Introduction Method¬†Results Link to public code repository </description>

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&#39;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&#39;t cover using CSS to style your theme.&#xA;We&#39;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>
