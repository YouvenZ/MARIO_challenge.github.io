      <description>The challenges offer the following The top ten performing teams will¬†be invited to participate in a challenge paper. The top-5 teams can have up to 5 co-authors each, while the 6th to¬†10th place teams can have up to 3 co-authors each. In the paper, we will publish a substantial summary of the¬†challenge results. Thank to the initiative of the BASIRA¬†lab¬†and in collaboration with MICCAI PRIME Workshop.</description>

      <description>Evaluation We will use a single metric per task to determine the performance of submitted results. To access the evaluation code that we will use in the challenge, take a look at our GitHub page. For task 1 The following metrics will be used in the leader board for both phase of task 1&#xA;F1-score, Specificity, Rk-correlation coefficient (RkC) For task 2 The following metrics will be used in the leader board for both phase of task 2</description>

      <description>Challenge papers To ensure transparency and reproducibility, we require participants to submit a brief method description alongside their final test set results. This description should follow the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) format.¬†An Overleaf template is available¬†template¬†to facilitate this process.&#xA;The paper description should focus on the key steps involved in developing your submitted approach.¬†Here are some recommended elements to¬†include:&#xA;Introduction Method¬†Results Link to public code repository </description>

      <description>Data source(s) characteristics Imaging data was acquired with a Spectralis OCT device (Heidelberg Engineering). B-scan definition was 496x1024 pixels; the number of B-scans per C-scan was patient dependent (typically 49 B- scans). Consecutive examinations were registered using the Spectralis follow-up option. The data was exported in XML+bitmap format using the Spectralis software version 6.9.4.0. Data was collected at the Ophthalmology department of Brest University Hospital (France). All patients are followed-up for monitoring and treatment of vascular AMD.</description>

      <description>Two tasks will be addressed in the challenge: The first task focuses on pairs of 2D slices (B-scans) from two consecutive OCT acquisitions. The goal is to classify the evolution between these two slices (before and after), which clinicians typically examine side by side on their screens.
